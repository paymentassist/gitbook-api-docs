# Plan Types

Update 2019-12-06: A list of all available plan types along with the relevant `plan_id`'s can now be found within the Dealer Dashboard. Simply login and navigate to the **Settings** section and select the **API** tab for full details.

Alternatively, available plan types are also available via API from the [/account](methods/account.md) endpoint.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you only have access to a single plan type, then there is no need to send either a `plan_id` or `plan_length` parameter in your request. For all other use-cases, please contact [ben@payment-assist.co.uk](mailto:ben@payment-assist.co.uk) for details of the correct values to send.
{% endhint %}
