# Test Environment

We run a fully-functional demo/test environment for use while carrying out a technical integration as well as for ongoing sales demonstration purposes.

To gain access, please contact [admin@payment-assist.co.uk](mailto:admin@payment-assist.co.uk?subject=Demo/Test%20Account).

Your test and live credentials can be identified by the prefix on the API secret:  
- `prod_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` = production/live  
- `demo_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` = demo/test

To complete a full customer test you can use the Visa test card number \(4111 1111 1111 1111\) along with any valid expiry date and CVV. Ensure the cardholder name matches the name on the application to avoid simulated rejections.
